I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Mathematics. In the fall, I will be joining the PhD program in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie broadly in Bayesian inference and statistical learning, independently and at their intersection. I am also deeply intrigued by and eager to explore topics related to ethical machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am excited to apply statistics in diverse fields, such as economics, sports, health, and social sciences.

Beyond academics, I like to stay active by playing soccer and lifting weights. I also enjoy watching sports, playing video games, traveling, reading, and spending time with my wife.
