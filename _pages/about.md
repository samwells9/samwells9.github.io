I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Mathematics, with plans to pursue a PhD in Statistics in the fall of 2025. My research interests lie broadly in Bayesian inference and statistical learning, independently and at their intersection. I am also open to conducting research related to algorithmic fairness and ethical AI. I am excited to apply statistics in diverse fields, such as economics, policy, public health, and sports.
