I am currently a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to starting the program, I graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Statistics and a minor in Mathematics. My research interests include Bayesian inference, statistical learning, and spatio-temporal statistics. As I explore these areas, I am committed to the ethical practice of statistics and aim to produce work that benefits society. I am excited by the opportunity to apply statistics in meaningful ways, whatever the field.

Beyond academics, I like to stay active by playing soccer and lifting weights. I also enjoy golfing, watching sports, playing video games, traveling, reading, and spending time with my wife.
