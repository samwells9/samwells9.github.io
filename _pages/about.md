I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Mathematics, with plans to pursue a PhD in Statistics in the fall of 2025. My research interests include Bayesian inference and statistical learning, both as independent fields and at their intersection. I am also open to conducting research related to algorithmic fairness and ethical AI. I am excited at the prospect of applying these interests across diverse fields, such as neuroscience, economics/finance, and sports.
