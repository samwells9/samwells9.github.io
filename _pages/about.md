I am currently a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to attending UT Austin, I graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in Statistics and a minor in Mathematics. My research interests include Bayesian inference, statistical learning, and trustworthy AI. As I explore these areas, I am committed to the ethical practice of statistics and aim to produce work that benefits society. I am excited by the opportunity to apply statistics in meaningful ways, whatever the field.

Beyond academics, I like to stay active by playing soccer and golf. I also enjoy watching sports, playing video games, lifting weights, traveling, reading, and spending time with my wife.
