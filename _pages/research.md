I am currently exploring a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest Geometry and Accuracy Preserving (RF-GAP) Proximities. 
I started by building a Python implementation that uses RF-GAP proximities to impute missing data. Now, I am in the process of testing the performance of this method of imputation against the MICE, MissForest, and KNN methods.
