I am currently exploring a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest Geometry and Accuracy Preserving (RF-GAP) Proximities. 
I started by building a Python implementation that uses RF-GAP proximities to impute missing data. Now, I am in the process of testing the performance of this method of 
imputation against the MICE, MissForest, and KNN methods. \

Imputation is vital to maintaining the integrity and completeness of the data. When we accurately impute missing values, we can be more confident that the insights we extract from the data are a valid reflection of reality. Beyond imputation, there are several other applications of RF-GAP proximities, such as uncertainty quantification, multidimensional scaling, and outlier detection, that I am excited to explore.
