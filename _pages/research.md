As an undergraduate student, I explored a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest Geometry and Accuracy Preserving (RF-GAP) Proximities under the guidance of my advisor, Jake Rhodes. 
During that time, I built a Python implementation of missing data imputation using RF-GAP proximities and compared its performance to that of MICE, MissForest, KNN, and various other imputation methods.
