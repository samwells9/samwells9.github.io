I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Mathematics. In the fall, I will be joining the PhD program in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie in Bayesian inference, statistical learning, and spatio-temporal statistics, independently and at their intersections. Alongside these interests, I am committed to practicing statistics ethically and advocating for the responsible use of statistical and machine learning methods. I am excited to apply statistics to areas such as environmental science, health, sports, and the social sciences.

Beyond academics, I like to stay active by playing soccer and lifting weights. I also enjoy watching sports, playing video games, traveling, reading, and spending time with my wife.
