My current research has focused on exploring a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest Geometry and Accuracy Preserving (RF-GAP) Proximities. 
I started by building a Python implementation that uses RF-GAP proximities to impute missing data. Now, I am in the process of testing the performance of this method of 
imputation against the MICE, MissForest, and KNN methods. There are yet many potential applications for the proximities that I am excited to explore.
