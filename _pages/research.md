As an undergraduate student, I explored a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest Geometry and Accuracy Preserving (RF-GAP) Proximities under the guidance of my advisor, Jake Rhodes. During that time, I built a Python implementation of missing data imputation using RF-GAP proximities and compared its performance to that of MICE, MissForest, KNN, and various other imputation methods.  

While at BYU, I also had the chance to do soccer research with Nathan Sandholtz. The goal was to build a game-theoretic model of attackerâ€“keeper dynamics in penalties that accounts for kicker execution error, allowing us to identify optimal shooting strategies tailored to individual players. For this project, I developed a probabilistic simulation framework in R to model scoring probabilities under varying execution errors and goalkeeper dive strategies.
